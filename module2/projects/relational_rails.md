title: Relational Rails
---

## Learning Goals

* Design a one to many relationship using a schema designer
* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
* Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
* Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers
* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior

## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.2.4.3
- must use PostgreSQL
- must "handroll" all routes (no use of `resources` syntax)
- must use `form_tag` for all forms (no use of `form_for`)

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project, please get permission from your instructors first

## Rubric


| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **Database Design** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including edge cases, and at least one extension story completed | Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code. | Clear schema design with detailed and accurate diagram. Migration history reflects table alterations not taught in class. All data types in the schema make logical sense. | Inheritance is utilized to DRY up duplicate queries. | 100% coverage for features and models. Either a gem that enhances testing effectiveness is implemented (orderly, factorybot, faker, etc) or within blocks are used throughout tests. |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement functionality. | Students can defend any of their design decisions. Routing is organized and consistent and demonstrates use of some RESTful principles. Students can describe how data is passed in their application.| Relationships modeled in the database correctly. Appropriate use of foreign keys. Schema design accurately represents actual database schema and design document is linked in the README | ActiveRecord helpers are utilized whenever possible. ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data. No Ruby is used to process data. All queries functional and accurately implemented.| 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. Students can point to the difference between integration and unit testing. |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students fail to complete 3-5 User Stories. | Students cannot defend some of their design decisions. Students inaccurately describe how some of their data is passed through their application. Routes don't demonstrate any use of RESTful design. | Some errors in database schema. Schema diagram lacks detail or accurate representation in database. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. Some instances where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. Some queries not accurately implemented. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 6 or more User Stories. | Students do not effectively organize code. | Poor diagram design. Relationships do not make sense or not accurately modeled in the database. Many errors in database schema. | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord. Many cases where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. |

## Relationships

### Design your database  

Do not use Parent/Child as your relationship

Each person will come up with their own one to many relationship. This should represent a real world example of your choice. An example would be:
- Shelters and Pets
- A Shelter has many Pets
- A Pet belongs to a Shelter.

These relationships are yours to create, but we instructors are happy to provide feedback on the relationships if asked.

Use [This database design site](https://www.dbdesigner.net/) to design your database with **2 one to many relationships.**

Here is an example diagram:

Schema Design

You can create as many columns on each table as you would like, but we need a few columns represented on at least one table:
    1. One boolean column
    2. One numeric column
    3. Two DateTime columns

Each table must have a name column
```
**Schema Design will be reviewed at our first check-in**

## User Stories

### CRUD Functionality

#### Parent
```
[ ] done

User Story 1, Parent Index (x2)

For each parent table
As a visitor
When I visit '/parents'
Then I see the name of each parent record in the system
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 2, Parent Show (x2)

As a visitor
When I visit '/parents/:id'
Then I see the parent with that id including the parent's attributes:
- data from each column that is on the parent table
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 3, Parent Creation (x2)

As a visitor
When I visit the Parent Index page
Then I see a link to create a new Parent record, "New Parent"
When I click this link
Then I am taken to '/parents/new' where I  see a form for a new parent record
When I fill out the form with a new parent's attributes:
And I click the button "Create Parent" to submit the form
Then a `POST` request is sent to the '/parents' route,
a new parent record is created,
and I am redirected to the Parent Index page where I see the new Parent displayed.
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 4, Parent Update (x2)

As a visitor
When I visit a parent show page
Then I see a link to update the parent "Update Parent"
When I click the link "Update Parent"
Then I am taken to '/parents/:id/edit' where I  see a form to edit the parent's attributes:
When I fill out the form with updated information
And I click the button to submit the form
Then a `PATCH` request is sent to '/parents/:id',
the parent's info is updated,
and I am redirected to the Parent's Show page where I see the parent's updated info
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 5, Parent Delete (x2)

and I am redirected to the parent index page where I no longer see this parent
```

---

#### Children
Children can be associated to the Parent. Children belong to a parent.

Anywhere you see `child_table_name` think `pets` from our Pets and Shelters example.
